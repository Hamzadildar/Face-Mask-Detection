COVID-19: Face Mask Detector with OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning

I’ll use this Python script to train a face mask detector and review the results.

Given the trained COVID-19 face mask detector, I’ll proceed to implement two more additional Python scripts used to:

Detect COVID-19 face masks in images
Detect face masks in real-time video streams
